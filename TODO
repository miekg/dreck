- move exec to a check: https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/runs/
  possibly putting the stdout/stderr in a comment still.
  Or possible the github actions, which seems way more powerful - then we can remove dreck.yaml completely?
- figure out how to unCc yourself; is this the notification api?
- issue creation handling?
