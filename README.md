# Dreck

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/miekg/dreck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/miekg/dreck)

Dreck can help you with managing pull requests and issues in your GitHub project. Dreck currently
can:

* Label/close/lock etc. issues.
* Assign reviewers to a pull request based on *OWNERS* files.
* Automatically delete the branch when a pull request is merged.
* Automatically merge a pull request when the status is green.
* LGTM a pull request with a comment.
* Run (whitelisted) commands on the dreck server.

Dreck is a fork of [Derek](https://github.com/alexellis/derek). It adds Caddy integration, so you can
"just" run it as a plugin in Caddy. It also massively expands on the number of features.

For this all to work, you'll need to have an Github App that allows access to your repo - setting
this up is beyond scope of this documentation. And need to recompile Caddy and have a functional Go
setup; again: all beyond the scope of this document.

## Config in caddy

If configuring Caddy, you need to recompile it with the *dreck* plugin enabled. After that the
following configuration is available.

~~~
dreck {
    client_id ID
    private_key PATH
    owners NAME
    secret SECRET
    path PATH
    merge STRATEGY
    validate
}
~~~

* `client_id` is mandatory and must be the client **ID** of the Github App.
* `private_key` specifies the **PATH** of the private key of the Github App. This is also mandatory.
* `secret` can optionally specify a **SECRET** for the webhook.
* `owners` can optionally specify a **NAME** for the OWNERS files, defaults to "OWNERS".
* `path` trigger Dreck when the webhook hits **PATH**, defaults to "/dreck".
* `merge` defines the **STRATEGY** for merging, possible values are `merge`, `squash` or `rebase`,
  it defaults to `squash`.
* `validate` enable HMAC validation of the request.

## OWNERS File Syntax

The OWNERS file syntax is borrowed from Kubernetes and extended with a `features` and `aliases`
section that allows you to configure dreck. This file should live in the top level directory of the
repository.

``` yaml
approvers:
    - name1
    - name2

reviewers:
    - name3
    - name4

features:
    - feature1
    - feature2

aliases:
    - |
      alias1
    - |
      alias2
```

An example:

~~~ yaml
approvers:
    - miek
reviewers:
    - miek
runners:
    - miek
features:
    - comments
    - run
aliases:
    - |
      /plugin: (.*) -> /label add: plugin/$1
    - |
      /release: (.*) -> /run: /opt/bin/release $1
~~~

### Features

The following features are available.

* `comments` - allow commands (see below) in comments.
* `reviewers` - assign reviewers for the pull request based on changed files and reviewers in the relevant
  OWNERS files.
* `dco` - check if a pull request has "Signed-off-by" (that literal string) and if not ask for it to be done.
  Needs a "no-dco" label in the repository for it to work.
* `aliases` - enable alias expansion.
* `branches` - enables the deletion of branches after a merge of a pull request.
* `autosubmit` - enables `/autosubmit`.
* `run` - enables `/run`.

When using email to reply to an issue, the email *must* start with the command, i.e. `/label rm: bug`
and include no lines above that.

Commands and aliases are detected in a case insensitive manner.

Multiple command in one message/issue are not supported.

## Supported Commands

### Comments

The following commands are supported.

* `/label add: LABEL`, label an issue with **LABEL**.
* `/label: LABEL`,  short for "label add".
* `/label remove: LABEL`, remove **LABEL**.
* `/label rm: LABEL`, short for "label remove",
* `/assign: ASSIGNEE`, assign issue to **ASSIGNEE**, `me` can be used as a shortcut for the commenter
* `/unassign: ASSIGNEE`, unassigns **ASSIGNEE**.
* `/close`, close issue.
* `/reopen`, reopen issue.
* `/title set: TITLE`, set the title to **TITLE**.
* `/title: TITLE`: short for "title set".
* `/title edit: TITLE`, set the title to **TITLE**.
* `/lock`, lock the issue.
* `/unlock`, unlock the issue.
* `/run COMMAND`, run **COMMAND** on the dreck server. Can only be performed by runners, and only
  via an expanded alias.

The case of these commands is ignored.

### Pull Requests

For pull requests all modified, added and removed files are checked. We crawl the path upwards
until we find an OWNERS file. We will then randomly assign someone from the reviewers to review the
pull request. This is only done when the pull request does not have any reviewers.

This is *not* done for pull request that have `WIP` (case insensitive) as a prefix in the title, when the
title is changed to a non Work-in-Progress one, we will perform this check. The full list of WIP
checks is: `WIP`, `WIP:`, `[WIP]` and `[WIP]:`.

Further more the following extra command is supported for pull request issues comments (ignored for issues).

* `/lgtm`, approve the pull request.
* `/autosubmit`, when all checks are OK, automatically merge the pull request. This will wait for 30
  minutes for all tests to complete. The label 'autosubmit' is added to the pull request.
  Note that the command `/autosubmit` can *also be given in the pull request body*. If we dreck sees
  this it will perform the same checks and, if allowed, we start autosubmitting.

## Aliases

The `aliases` sections of the OWNERS file allows you to specify alias for other commands. It's
a regular expression based format and looks like this: `alias -> command`. Note the this is:
`<space>-><space>`, e.g.:

~~~
/plugin: (.*) -> /label add: plugin/$1
~~~

This defines a new command `/plugin: forward` that translates into `/label add: plugin/forward`.
The regular expression `(.*)` catches the argument after `/plugin: ` and `$1` is the first expression
match group.

The alias expansion is done is a case insensitive manner.

Note this entire string needs to be taken literal in the OWNERS file to be valid yaml:

~~~ yaml
aliases:
    - |
      /plugin: (.*) -> /label add: plugin/$1
~~~

### Run

Run allows for processes be started on the dreck server. For this the `run` feature *and* the
`aliases` feature must be enabled. Next runners must be defined in the OWNERS file. Only commands
*expanded* by an alias are allowed to run, this is to prevent things like `/run /bin/cat
/etc/passwd` to be run accidentally.

All commands run will get one default argument, which is either the issue or pull request number,
if the command is given in an issue dreck will run `/cmd issue:NUMBER`, if done for a pull request
that parameter it will be `/cmd pull:NUMBER`.

For example, if you want to run `/opt/bin/release ARGUMENT` on the server, the following alias must
be there:

~~~
/release: (.*) -> /run: /opt/bin/release $1
~~~

If you then call the command with `/release 0.1` in issue 42. Dreck will run:

~~~
/opt/bin/release issue:42 0.1
~~~

Note that in this case `/cat -> /run: /bin/cat /etc/resolv.conf`, running `cat /etc/passwd` *still*
yields in an (unwanted?) disclosure because the final command being run is `/bin/cat
/etc/resolv.conf /etc/passwd`. In other words be careful of what commands you whitelist.

## Branches

With this enabled, *dreck* will, after each closed pull request, look to see if the branch is
merged, but not deleted. If this is true, it will delete the branch. The *master* branch is always
excluded from this.

## Bugs

We don't support multiple commands in an comment issue.
